# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-27
### Added
- **Presence indicator**: dot now also shows ● yellow when a scheduled or in-flight mission departs from or arrives at the body (green still takes precedence over yellow, yellow over grey).

### Changed
- Presence dot rendering: filled dots rode low against their label because TMP's Center alignment centres on font line metrics, not glyph ink, and the filled/hollow glyphs sit differently on the baseline. Switched to Midline alignment and bumped filled size to 18pt so both share an optical centre.

### Fixed
- Switching craft no longer recalculates the table. Optimal and Return windows come from a Lambert search that ignores the Δv cap, so they're craft-independent, and Fuel/thrust are computed at render time — only Fastest depends on the craft. Each scan now keeps the Pareto frontier of its (arrival, Δv) solutions, so Fastest is re-picked for the new budget with no Lambert solves at all; a rescan happens only for entries with no stored frontier (e.g. loaded from a sidecar), and only while the Fastest section is visible.
- Thrust feasibility check silently disabled itself (no amber flag, indistinguishable from every window being fine) whenever a craft's thrust reflection read as 0. Now logs each craft's thrust/constant-acceleration reading and the game's multiplier on selection, warns loudly when either is missing, and reports a per-refresh count of how many optimal windows are thrust-short so it's clear the check is actually running.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-25
### Added
- **Presets dropdown** replaces the My Bases button. Contains My Bases plus one entry per in-game celestial body group (`ObjectInfoGroups`): Near-Earth Objects, Inner Belt, Middle Belt, Outer Belt, Jupiter Trojans, Kuiper Belt, etc. — the same classification the game's search window uses, listed sunward-out. Clicking a preset adds every group member known to the ephemeris.
- **Clear** button in the panel header removes all destinations at once.
- **Moon search**: searching a moon's name ("Ganymede") now matches, shown as "Ganymede → Jupiter" and adding the parent planet — the ephemeris is heliocentric, so moons resolve to their parents for transfer purposes.
- **Icons**: search results and preset entries show the body/group icon before the name; the Craft dropdown shows each craft's sprite, with ALL-CAPS names displayed Title Cased ("Prometheus").
- **Planets preset** (Mercury–Neptune, incl. Mars) directly after My Bases.
- **Thrust feasibility**: windows the game would refuse with "Not enough thrust for this maneuver" are shown in amber. Mirrors the game's finite-burn check (burn time = Δv × economic multiplier / (thrust/mass) must fit within the travel time), using research-adjusted `GetThrust` and the game's own `DeltaVMultiplayerCheckingThrust` constant; solar sails and constant-acceleration drives are exempt, as in the game. Red (over Δv budget) takes precedence.
- **Presence indicator**: a dot before each destination name — ● green when you have facilities built on the body (probes excluded, moons count toward their parent, same rule as My Bases), ○ grey otherwise. Updates on every refresh.
- **Solar Orbit** is now a selectable origin in the From dropdown. The game models it as a virtual location (no orbit of its own, pinned to the Sun at a conventional 0.01 AU — `ObjectInfo.distanceSolarOrbitAU`), so the mod synthesizes a circular 0.01 AU heliocentric orbit in Earth's orbital plane for transfer computation. Real `EObjectTypes.SolarOrbit` bodies, if present in the scene, are accepted as origins too.
- **Sortable columns**: Δv, Arrives, and Fuel sub-headers are now clickable sort toggles, like Departs (Fuel sorts by Δv, to which it is monotonic).
- **Options dropdown** in the header (before Clear), persisted in the BepInEx config: *Show Δv column* (default off — column hidden), *Show next transfer window* (default off — hides the dimmed second row **and skips its computation**; re-enabling backfills via cheap partial recalcs), *Show Fastest* (default off — hides the Fastest section; its data rides along with the Optimal grid scan so this is a free visibility toggle), and *Show Return trip* (default on).
- **Show undiscovered** option (default off): undiscovered bodies are hidden from the table and search; when on, they appear with greyed-out names. Presets always add undiscovered group members (hidden until toggled on), and hidden rows skip window computation until revealed.
- **Alert lead time**: new "Alert [N] day(s) before" editable field in the Options dropdown (default 0, persisted). Alarms are now day-precise — the key stores the departure day — and fire N days ahead; legacy month-granularity alarms from old sidecars still fire on their month. Notification/toast text is title-cased ("Launch Window (Optimal) …") and dates use yy/MM/dd.
- **Return-trip alarms**: the Return section has the same ☐ notify checkboxes as Optimal/Fastest — arm one to get an in-game notification (game pauses) when the return window arrives; the notification reads dest → origin. Persisted in the sidecar (new `isReturn` flag, backward compatible with old sidecars).
- **Return section** (replaces Fastest by default): the first optimal transfer window from the destination back to the origin departing after arrival, with the same Departs/Arrives/Δv/Fuel columns, sortable sub-headers, and next-window row. Computed on demand — only while the section is visible, with missing windows backfilled by the next refresh (Calculating overlay covers it); cached per origin and untouched by the sidecar format. The panel width adapts to the visible sections.
- Column order per side is now Departs | Arrives | Δv | Fuel.
- **Fuel (E/F)** column after Travel in both the Optimal and Fastest groups: estimated propellant for each window via the rocket equation (dry mass × (e^(Δv/ve) − 1)), using the selected craft's exhaust velocity from `SpacecraftType.GetExhaustV(player)` — which already includes the company's researched exhaust-velocity bonuses, so the figure always reflects the current engine variant. Shows Empty/Full-cargo load ("23.8/31.2t", ≥1000t rendered as kt); "—" for solar sails or when no craft data is available.
- Table value cells use Orbitron (the game's HUD-numeral font, near-uniform glyph widths) since the game ships no true monospace font; a "Mono" font is preferred automatically if one ever appears.
### Changed
- Removed the status line ("Updated…", "Calculating…", "Added N…") between the header and the table; the full-panel Calculating overlay already covers refresh feedback.
- Entire UI enlarged ~1.5×: fonts (labels 15pt, row values 16pt, tooltips 13pt), panel 650×380→975×570, and all column widths, row heights, dropdowns, toasts, and the toggle button scaled proportionally.
- Per-row × delete button moved from the name cell to the trailing edge of the row.
- Travel column replaced by **Arrives** (estimated arrival date); Departs and Arrives both use `yy/MM/dd` format (e.g. 26/07/18).
- Both opportunity rows now use the same 15pt value font (first row is no longer larger — dimming alone distinguishes the next window), and the Δv columns are narrower (95/110px).
### Fixed
- **Destinations, alarms, and caches now survive exiting and restarting the game.** The sidecar persisted NBody instance ids, which Unity reassigns every session (verified: the same Earth was saved as three different ids across three sessions), so everything was silently dropped on the next launch. Sidecars (v4) now persist display names, resolved back to live ids on load; old id-based sidecars still load within the session that wrote them.
- Body search could show nothing for queries like "7" when the first alphabetical matches were all already in the destination list — the 10-result cap applied before filtering them out. Filters now run first, and prefix matches rank ahead of substring matches ("7" → "7 Iris" before "17 Thetis").
- Armed alarm checkboxes no longer lose their ✓ after closing/reopening: the visual match used an exact year/month/day key, which a one-day drift in the epoch→date conversion (or a re-derived window) silently orphaned. Alarms now match their window slot within ±16 days (adjacent windows are months apart, so no mis-match is possible).
- The Craft dropdown only listed types with a completed ship, so a freshly researched craft (e.g. Stratos still under construction) was missing. It now also includes unlocked types via the same API the game's mission planner uses (`AllSpacecraftType.GetUnlockRocketType`).
- Repeated panel opens no longer redo work: destinations whose search found no window are not re-searched until game time advances ~1/24 of the origin's orbit; a return-window backfill that found no second-row solution is not re-attempted; and the on-open ephemeris scene rescan is throttled to every 30 real seconds. (Cached future-dated windows were already reused — only expired windows trigger recalculation.)
- Solar Orbit as a destination (or origin) showed "—" in every column: its ~9-hour orbital period collapsed the synodic-derived search spans to hours, where no Lambert transfer exists. With wildly mismatched periods the finder now spans the slower body's orbit instead.
- Runtime-created asteroids (the game spawns randomly generated NEOs like LU4-6533 during play) were invisible to search and skipped by presets because the ephemeris was built once per session. It now rebuilds on panel open / Refresh, and a preset add that meets an unknown group member forces a rebuild before adding.
- Undiscovered bodies (not yet found by the player) are shown with a greyed-out name instead of white — the game's own lists hide them entirely.
- Mouse-wheel scrolling now works from anywhere over the destination list, not only when hovering raycastable elements like body names.
- Fuel figures exceeding the craft's tank capacity (`GetFuelCapacity`) are flagged red — the Fastest Δv cap assumes an empty craft with full tanks, so full-cargo loads can require more propellant than the tank holds.
- Departure column widened (62→72 / 70→80 px) so the sort arrow ("Departs ▲/▼") is no longer ellipsized at the larger font size.
- Destroyed bodies (`ObjectInfo.IsInGameDestroy` — impacted, nuked, or mined-out asteroids like EX0-99) are now hidden from presets, search results, and the origin dropdown, and are auto-removed from the destination table on refresh.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-07-03
### Fixed
- Clicking a body name in the launch window panel now correctly opens the body's detail panel. Previously used a reflection-based method that broke after a game update.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-06-27
### Changed
- Origin dropdown sort is now three-tier: presence → planet/non-planet → alphabetical.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-24
### Added
- Origin dropdown now shows planets where you have ships first, then everything else. Both groups alphabetized.
- Destinations are now saved to the sidecar file continuously as you make changes, not only on game save. Fixes destinations disappearing after switching origins or reloading.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- Fastest checkboxes in the second window row were misaligned with the first row.
- Unchecked checkboxes no longer show a hazy background box.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- `_firedAlarms` set is now cleared on sidecar load, preventing unbounded growth across a long session.
- Per-origin window caches restored from the sidecar now go through the same opt2/fst promotion logic as the active origin; previously a restored non-active origin that had been promoted at save-time would never compute its second window after being switched to.
- Pending opt2/fst recalc sets are now saved and restored when switching origins, so a partial recalc in-flight when the user switches away is correctly resumed on switch-back.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- Craft change now clears cached fastest windows for all origins, not just the active one; previously switching craft then switching away and back to an origin could show fastest windows computed with the old craft's dV budget.
- Per-origin window caches are now persisted to the sidecar file and restored on load, so switching origins after a reload no longer forces a full recalculation.
- Background Lambert grid calculations now cap thread usage at ProcessorCount−2, leaving headroom for the game's render thread.

### Changed
- Build system aligned with FleetTracker: uses `SOLAR_EXPANSE_ROOT` environment variable (set via `.mise.toml`); csproj validates the path and auto-copies the DLL after build. `SOLAR_EXPANSE_GAME` is still accepted as a legacy alias.
- Added `mise run test` task (`scripts/test`) for running the unit suite without a game install.
- Save format bumped to version 3 (backwards compatible; old saves load without data loss).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-17
### Added
- **Launch window alarms** — checkbox on each window row fires a real game notification when the departure window arrives, pausing the game. Notification shows origin and destination planet icons with highlighted names.
- **Clickable destination names** — click a destination to open its in-game info panel. Planet icon shown alongside each name.
- **My Bases** now adds the parent planet when a facility is on a moon (e.g. a base on Callisto also adds Jupiter).
- My Bases tooltip explaining inclusion criteria.
- Per-origin window cache — switching back to a previously-calculated origin restores cached data immediately instead of recalculating.
- Column headers (DESTINATION / OPTIMAL / FASTEST) use the game's own locale strings.

### Fixed
- Column headers, sub-headers, and data cells now align correctly.
- Solar sail craft (e.g. Daedalus) no longer shows incorrect Fastest windows; solar range shown in AU; out-of-range destinations greyed out.
- Spacecraft in transit (not docked) now appear in the Craft dropdown.
- Saved destination lists now persist across multiple saves of the same campaign.
- Selected craft is restored when reloading a save.
- My Bases excludes exploration probes.
- Switching to an origin with no saved destinations now picks a sensible default instead of showing an empty panel.
- Search dropdown no longer lists bodies already in the table.
- Search input no longer loses keyboard focus while typing.
- Saved data now loads correctly on game startup.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-06
### Added
- From dropdown is now a typeahead: opens with a filter box, list sorted alphabetically.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-03
### Added
- Initial release.
- Launch Windows panel showing optimal and fastest transfer windows for all planets.
- Second row per destination with next synodic-period window for longer-term planning.
- From dropdown to change origin body.
- Craft dropdown to set Δv budget; destinations outside budget shown in red.
- My Bases button to auto-add bodies where the player has built facilities.
- Body search to add any celestial body to the table.
- Calculating overlay shown during background Lambert grid computation.
- Data clears immediately on origin or craft change so stale values are never visible.
