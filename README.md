# Solar Expanse Launch Windows

A BepInEx plugin for Solar Expanse that adds a **Launch Windows** panel showing
optimal and fastest transfer windows to every planet (and any other body you add)
from your current origin.

## What it does

The panel appears as a button next to the Life Support / Power Tracker buttons in
the top bar. Click it to open, drag to reposition.

For each destination it shows two windows — one minimising Δv (Optimal) and one
minimising travel time within your spacecraft's Δv budget (Fastest) — plus a
dimmed second row with the next synodic-period window for longer-term planning.

**From / Craft dropdowns** — change origin body or filter by a spacecraft in your
fleet. Destinations outside the selected craft's Δv budget are shown in red.

**My Bases** — auto-adds every body where you have a built facility.

**Search** — type any body name to add it to the table.

### A note on accuracy

Windows are computed with the same Lambert solver and the same grid parameters the
game's Mission Planner uses internally, so departure dates match what you'll see
when you open the planner. Δv figures are close but not identical: the planner
applies company research bonuses and exact fuel-load optimisation that this panel
does not replicate. Treat the Δv numbers as planning estimates; the dates are the
important output.

## Installation

1. Install **BepInEx 5.4** if you haven't already:
   https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html
2. Run Solar Expanse once after installing BepInEx to generate the `BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
3. Download the latest release zip.
4. Extract `SolarExpanseLaunchWindows.dll` from the zip into:
   ```
   Solar Expanse/BepInEx/plugins/
   ```
5. Launch the game. The **LAUNCH WINDOWS** button will appear in the top bar.

## Building from source

Requires .NET SDK and the game installed locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stockmaj/solar-expanse-launch-windows
cd solar-expanse-launch-windows
bash build.sh
```

`build.sh` compiles the mod and copies the DLL directly into your local game's
`BepInEx/plugins/` folder. Set `SOLAR_EXPANSE_GAME=<path>` to override the
default game location.
